# Higher/Lower Movie Rating Game

A browserâ€‘based game where players guess which movie has the higher IMDb rating. Built as a **personal learning project to get started with React**, it goes beyond a simple tutorial by adding **local score persistence** and **performance optimisations** to reduce unnecessary API calls and improve responsiveness.  

Originally hosted at **higherlowermovies.com**, the domain was discontinued due to high renewal costs. The project remains live via its **Vercel deployment** and is fully openâ€‘source on GitHub.
